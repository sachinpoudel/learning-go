 // interfaces in go are used to define a set of method signatures that a type must implement to satisfy the interface.
 // An interface type is defined using the "type" keyword followed by the interface name and the "interface" keyword.
 // in simple terms, interfaces allow us to define behavior that can be shared across different types without requiring them to be related through a common ancestor.
